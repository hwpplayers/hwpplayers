## About various licenses

### For small projects

For small projects that have 300 lines of code or less, use the AGPLv3 or GPLv3 license, or a license compatible with AGPLv3 or GPLv3.

### For Other Projects

If the program runs over a network please choose AGPLv3 license otherwise GPLv3 should be chosen.

#### Code distribution rules

hwpplayers never puts source code/information into master-x branches without security testing and correcting the information. Test twice your code and information and then send your pull request to all branches (devel-x and master-x). hwpplayers plays, fixes, tries, makes.
