hwpplayers ( hard working philosophers players ) is a hackerspace ( please look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace ) for free software developers , admins and other content makers. For the meaning of hwpplayers please look at https://www.stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html :

It is hard to write a simple definition of something as varied as hacking, but I think what these activities have in common is playfulness, cleverness, and exploration. Thus, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. Activities that display playful cleverness have "hack value".
